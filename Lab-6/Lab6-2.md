# Lab 6-2
The first subroutine called by main performs the if statement from lab 6-1.

The subroutine located at 0x40117F is printf.

The 2nd subroutine called from main is located at 0x0401040. It downloads the web page located at http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.html and parses an HTML comment from the beginning of the page. The code construct used in this subroutine is an array filled with data read from InternetReadFile. Each byte is compared one at a time to parse an HTML comment.

There are 2 network-based indicators: the user-agent "Internet Explorer 7.5/pma" and the download of the web page from http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.html.

The program checks for an active internet connection. If none exist, it will terminate. Else, it will try to download a web page located at http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.html and parses a comment from its beginning. The comment must start with "< !--". The next character, X, following that sequence is printed in the format "Success: Parsed command is X". If successful, the program sleeps for 1 minute and terminates.
