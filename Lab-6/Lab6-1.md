The major code construct in the subroutine sub_401000 is an if statement in address 0x00401000.

Looking at the if statement, we can see that a string is pushed right before the subroutine is called. In the subroutine itself, a string is initialized. As such we can infer that the subroutine sub_40105F is printf.

The purpose of this program is to check if there is an internet connection or not, and prints a message depending on the result. This program can be used by the malware to find if there is a connection before attempting to connect to the internet.
