# Lab 3-1
The malware appears to be packed. It's only import is ExitProcess function. However, the strings seem to not be obfuscated. The notable strings are:
* advapi32
* user32 
* advpack 
* www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com
* vmx32to64.exe
* CONNECT %s:%i HTTP/1.0
* SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders

The malware creates a file C:\windows\system32\vmx32.to64.exe and installs itself to run on startup by creating the registry key "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\VideoDriver" set to the file's location. The process Lab03-01.exe holds a mutex called WinVMX32. All 3 can be used as host-based indicators.

The malware constantly beacons a 256 bytes sized packet to the URL www.praticalmalwareanalysis.com containing seemingly random data, which can be used as a network-based signatures.
