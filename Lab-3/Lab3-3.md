# Lab 3-3
The malware replaces the svchost.exe file in C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe.

Comparing the disk image of svchost.exe and its memory image shows they are not the same. In the memory image there are new strings such as practicalmalwareanalysis.log and [ENTER].

The replaced svchost.exe files creates a new file %CurrentDirectory%\practicalmalwareanalysis.log. Inspecting its content shows us it is most likely a keylogger.

As such, the malware replaces the process svchost.exe and creates a keylogger file.
