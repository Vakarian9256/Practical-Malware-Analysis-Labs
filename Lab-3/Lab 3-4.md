# Lab 3-4
When running the .exe file, the program deletes itself as soon as it starts.

The program may need command-line arguments to stop itself from deleting itself on start-up.

Inspecting the strings in the .exe file shows us 3 strings who look like command-line arguments: -cc, -re & -in. However running the program with any of the flags doesn't prove fruitful.
