# Lab 7-3
The program achieves persistence by copying the Lab7-3.dll into a new DLL file C:\\windows\\system32\\kerne132.dll and modifying every .exe file on the system to import that DLL.
The new DLL file is a good host-base indicator for the malware. Another indicator is found in the Lab07-03.dll file, a mutex called SADFHUHF is created.

The purpose of this program is to create a backdoor that connects to a remote host. The backdoor can support 2 commands: one to execute a command and the other to sleep.

The malware is difficult to remove as it infects every .exe file in the system. The best way to remove it is to restore backups. If that proves too difficult or no backups exist, you can edit the malicious DLL file and remove its malicious content. Alternatively, you can copy the contents of kernel32.dll from a website, such as www.dll-files.com, and rename it to kerne132.dll.
