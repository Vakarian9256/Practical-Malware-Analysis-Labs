# Lab 9-3
In the executable imports table we can see DLL1.dll, DLL2.dll, kernel32.dll & NetAPI32.dll. Additionally, the malware dynamically loads DLL3.dll & user32.dll.

DLL1, DLL2 & DLL3 all share the same base image of 0x10000000.
After loading the executable in OllyDbg, DLL1 is located at this base image, DLL2 has been relocated to 0x330000 and DLL3 has been relocated to 0x390000. (Note that the values may vary on different machines)

The function DLL1PRINT prints "DLL 1 mystery data X" where X is the current process identifier.

To make debugging the functions imported from DLL2, we can choose the manual load option when loading the .dll file in IDA and insert the address we found earlier.
The function DLL2ReturnJ returns the filename of 'temp.txt' to be passed on as an argument to WriteFile.
The DLL2PRINT prints "DLL 2 mystery data X" where X is the handle to the open .txt file.

The NetScheduleJobAdd function gets pointer for the buffer parameter from DLL3GetStructure, which it dynamically resolves.
The DLL3PRINT function prints "DLL 3 mystery data X", where X is the address, in decimal, for that buffer, which also holds the string "ping www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com".
