# Lab 1-4
1. The program has been detected by 58 security vendors as malicious code.
2. There are no indications that the file has been packed.
3. The program was compiled on 30/8/2019. Note however that the book was published in 2012 and as such the compile time is obviously faked.
4. The imports from Advapi tell us the program is doing something with permissions. The imports CreateAFile and WinExec from kernel32 tell us it can write a file and then run it.
5. The string system32\wupdmgrd.exe suggests that the program will write a file and run it at that location. Additionaly, the URL www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe suggests that additional malware is located there.
6. There is another PE executable in the resource section. We'll use Resource Hacker to extract the section as a binary. Now we'll analyse it with PEview.
The import URLDownloadToFile, along with the URL mentioned bfore suggest that this executable serves as a downloader for additional malware from the listed URL.
