# Lab 1-2
1. 50 security vendors detected the software as malware.
2. The sections are named UPX, which tells us that the .exe has been packed by UPX. 
3. The interesting imports are CreateAService, InternetOpen
and InternetOpenURL. The imports suggest that the malware can create services and connect to the internet and open URLs.
4. Since InternetOpenURL is imported we should look for a URL in the data section. Unsuprisingly, we found a URL:www.malwareanalysisbook.com
Furthermore we can see a string "MalService" which tells us the program will probably create a service of that name. As such we should look for network traffic to the mentioned URL and the service MalService on infected machines as a network-based indicator and a host-based indicator, respectively.
