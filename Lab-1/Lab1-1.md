# Labs 1-1
1. After uploading both files, we can see that both files were detected. The .exe file has been detected by 46 security vendors and the .dll file has been detected by 40. 
   
2. To find out the compile time, we'll open up the files in PEview. The compile time is stated in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER which is in the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS section. We can see that the compile time for both files is 19/12/2010.
   
3. There are no indications to packing.

4. The imports in the .exe file: FindFirstFile, FindNextFile, CopyFile and CreateFile tell us that the malware searches the file system and can create & copy files.

 In the .dll the interesting imports are CreateAProcess and Sleep. We can also see that functions from WS_32 are imported for network functionality.

1. After looking at the data section in the .exe file, we can see there is a path for a file: "C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll". Previously, we saw that the malware can copy & create files. The path suggests it may create a file with a similar name to kernel32.dll, which can be a host-based indicator for suspicious activity.

2. Similarly to the previous question, we can look at the data section in the .dll file and see that there is an ip address listed: "127.26.152.13". The ip address can serve as a network-based indicator.

3. The .dll file is most likely a backdoor, and the .exe is a downloader which installs the backdoor.
